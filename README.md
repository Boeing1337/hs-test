# hs-test
It is a small framework that simplifies testing educational projects for Hyperskill. It is built on top of JUnit.

It is required to use for Hyperskill projects. Main features:
- black box testing (only need to know user's main method)
- multiple types of tests in a simple unified way (without stdin, with stdin, files, swing)
- generating learner-friendly feedback (filtering stack-traces, hints)
